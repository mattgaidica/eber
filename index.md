# Enhancing Bio-logging in Ecology Research (EBER) Initiative

## Problem Statement
The use of miniaturized, animal-borne bio-loggers to make physiological and environmental measurements from free-ranging animals is radically transforming scientific capabilities. Technological strides in battery, computation, memory, and sensor technology have supported a suite of bio-logging tools that are not only smaller and longer-lasting, but provide multi-featured, high-resolution data on hemodynamic, metabolic, and electrophysiological variables (Williams et al. 2019). However, even bio-loggers that begin as academic projects have quickly commercialized (Massot et al. 2019) making them expensive and proprietary impeding the broader research community from engaging population studies and standardizing measurement and analysis techniques.
